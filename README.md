This repo hosts a set of install scripts and config files for Debian 12, to automate installation and configuration of the i3 Window Manager and other packages. It is modular and you may enable/disable commands as desired. For best results, install on a a fresh Debian 12 with no GUI environment. 

I created this repo to archive and automate my own install process. My goal was to assemble a set of packages and scripts that would provide an attractive and efficient workflow, aimed primarily at those who avoid using the mouse, and those who want to maximize fine tuned control of their system. I chose i3 for it's ease of use modest learning curve. 

I want a minimal UI that provides exactly what is required, without installing a bloated or more limited desktop environment or a derivitive distribution with packages I do not need or want. I like a dark UI, but with some colorful accents, with emphasis on purple. Most of the packages enabled in the install script by default conform to the theme/icons, and get along well together. Alternative options were provided for your convenience. 

Some non-FOSS packages are included. My goal is to use FOSS wherever practical. I welcome suggestions for FOSS alternatives.
